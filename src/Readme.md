Course Grade Calculator
Instructions:
1. Course Grade Calculation:
   •
   Create a Java program that allows a student to input their scores (out of 100) for 7
   different courses.
   •
   Calculate the grade for each course based on the following criteria:
   • A: Score > 90
   • B: Score > 80
   • C: Score > 70
   • D: Score > 50
   • E: Score > 40
   • F: Score <= 40 (Fail)
2. Pass/Fail Evaluation:
   • If the overall grade for a course is A, B, or C, consider it a pass.
   • If the overall grade is D, E, or F, consider it a fail.
3. Display:
   • Display each course along with its corresponding grade.
   • Provide feedback for each course, indicating whether it was a pass or a fail based
   on the calculated grade.
